# Welcome to Mathletes!

### Team Members:
- Amy Liao
- Corey Beck
- Matthew LeFurge

### MVP

The MVP for Mathletes was to create an application that allows a signed up user to test their math skills with pre-made flashcards. The user would then be able to see their scores at the end of the flashcards as well as any flashcards taken in the past.

### Trello Board & Wireframe

Our team used a [Trello][] board to obtain an agile workflow.

### Team Dynamic and Git workflow

The Git workflow was simple: each member would take on a task via [Trello][] and when it is completed, move it to the 'Completed' section. Teammates would review each other's pushed work to ensure all requirements are met before merging it master.

The members of Mathletes wokred close together during the project and kept the goal in mind by consistantly communicating the status of the project with each other. The team leaned on each other for helped and guidence which contributed to the sucess of the project.
